    <h5>Steps to make</h5>
        <ol>
            <li> Preheat oven to 375 degrees F</li>
            <li> Preheat pan on the stove on meduim-high heat</li>
            <li> Start Boiling water for Rotinni Noodles</li>
            <li> Cut up all of the bacon and Chicken into one inch peices</li>
            <li> Place all of the bacon into the pan to cook until bacon is almost crispy</li>
            <li> Remove bacon from pan, and place in a bowl to be used later </li>
            <li> By this point your water should be boiling. Add your noodles to the boiling water.</li>
            <li> Add your Chicken to the pan in which you cooked the bacon, using the grease for flavoring</li>
            <li> Add Zesty Itialian Salad Dressing to the chicken pan</li>
            <li> Cook until chicken is golden brown, and the oil has started to dissapate from the pan</li>
            <li> Once both the chicken and noodles are done : grab a mixing bowl and put all of the chicken, 3/4 of the bacon, 2 Cups of cheese, the noodles, and your can of Cream of Chicken soup in and stir until everything is of similar texture.  </li>
            <li> Place the mixture into your favorite Casserole Dish</li>
            <li> Place remaining bacon and cheese on top of the dish</li>
            <li> Put the dish in the oven and let it cook for 20 minutes total (15 on bake and then turn to broil to get the nice brazed top).</li>
            <li> Remove pan and serve!(Note : I like to crush up the Cool Ranch Doritos and stir it into mine once it is in my personal bowl. Adds an amazing crunch and unique flavor to it!)</li>
        </ol>
